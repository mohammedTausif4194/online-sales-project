This project involved comprehensive analysis of online sales data, moving through the crucial stages of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Initially, raw sales data was meticulously cleaned to remove inconsistencies, duplicate entries, and missing values, resulting in a perfectly structured dataset.
Advanced data analysis techniques were then applied to uncover key sales trends, customer behaviors, and performance metrics.
The insights gained were effectively visualized using Power BI dashboards and interactive reports, providing actionable intelligence for business decision-making.
The end result is a robust, clear, and insightful presentation of online sales performance, empowering stakeholders to drive strategy with confidence.
